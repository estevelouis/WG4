DiversUtils
=========================


DiversUtils is a C/Python code base to measure diversity in linguistic data.
Measuring diversity of linguistic resources as well as system
predictions allows for insights in the representativeness of data.


Project Background

How to Use
====================

Both C and Python interfaces are available. The C interface has better
performance and is recommended for large-scale diversity benchmarking,
as is the purpose of WG4's efforts. The Python interface is better for
local-scale diversity measurement, and is intended to be usable for a
wider community, as well as to benefit of Python's existing stack.
